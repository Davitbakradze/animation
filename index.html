          <p class="story">The tradition of the Christmas tree has a rich and varied history, with roots that can be traced back to ancient times. However, the modern Christmas tree as we know it today has its origins in 16th-century Germany.</p>
          <p class="story">One popular story involves Martin Luther, a key figure in the Protestant Reformation. Legend has it that on a winter's night around the year 1500, Luther was walking through a forest and was struck by the beauty of the starlight shining through the evergreen trees. Inspired by this sight, he is said to have cut down a small fir tree, brought it home, and decorated it with candles to recreate the magical scene for his family.</p>
          <p class="story">Over the centuries, the tradition of decorating evergreen trees for Christmas spread throughout Germany and other parts of Europe. The trees were adorned with candles, fruits, nuts, and other ornaments. The practice gained popularity in various European countries, and by the 19th century, it had made its way to England and the United States.</p>
          <p class="story">In the 1840s, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who was of German descent, popularized the Christmas tree in England. An illustration of the royal family celebrating around a decorated Christmas tree was published, and this image helped solidify the tradition in English-speaking countries.</p>
          <p class="story">The Christmas tree tradition continued to evolve with the invention of electric lights, making it safer and more convenient to illuminate the tree. Today, Christmas trees are a central and cherished part of the holiday season in many cultures around the world. Families often gather to decorate the tree, exchange gifts, and create lasting memories during the festive season</p>

          <p class="story">Santa Claus—otherwise known as Saint Nicholas or Kris Kringle—has a long history steeped in Christmas traditions. Today, he is thought of mainly as the jolly man in red who brings toys to good girls and boys on Christmas Eve, but his story stretches all the way back to the 3rd century, when Saint Nicholas walked the earth and became the patron saint of children. Find out more about the history of Santa Claus from his earliest origins to the shopping mall Santas of today, and discover how two New Yorkers—Clement Clark Moore and Thomas Nast—were major influences on the Santa Claus millions of children wait for each Christmas Eve.</p>

          <h3 class="story-heading">Who is Rudolph</h3>
          <p class="story">Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is a fictional reindeer created by Robert L. May. Rudolph is usually depicted as the ninth and youngest of Santa Claus's reindeer, using his luminous red nose to lead the reindeer team and guide Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve. Though he initially receives ridicule for his nose as a fawn, the brightness of his nose is so powerful that it illuminates the team's path through harsh winter weather. Ronald D. Lankford, Jr., described Rudolph's story as "the fantasy story made to order for American children: each child has the need to express and receive approval for his or her individuality and/or special qualities. Rudolph's story embodies the American Dream for the child, written large because of the cultural significance of Christmas."</p>
